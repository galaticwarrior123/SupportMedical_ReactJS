# Medical Consulting Support Website
[Live Demo](https://supportmedical-reactjs.onrender.com/) <br>
Please note that the first request may take up to 1 minute due to being deployed on a free tier.

## About The Project
The website supports the connection between doctors and patients, providing basic functions such as creating posts, reacting a post, commenting, calling, texting, and making appointments for consultation. The website meets the criteria of a friendly interface, ease of use, fast access speed, and high security. \
The main purpose of building a website to support patients and doctors is to create an online bridge where patients can directly interact with medical professionals, share accurate and timely medical information, and at the same time create conditions for patients to ask questions and have their health concerns answered. In this way, patients will have the necessary knowledge to proactively take care of their health.
